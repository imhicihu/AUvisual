# RATIONALE #
* This repo collects technological tools and human insights inside an internal effort to produce, generate audiovisual communications to the community
* This repo is a living document that will grow and adapt over time

### What is this repository for? ###

    - ![graphics](https://bitbucket.org/repo/48bkkAE/images/3127751406-audio.jpg)
* Version 1.01

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
    - In the beginning, you can check our _colophon_ (see below): lots of (open source) tools to convert analog data (_human voice_) to the digital realm
* Configuration
    - Check up [colophon.md](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/auvisual/src/master/Colophon.md)
* Dependencies
    -  Lots of tools needs lots of dependencies. There is no universal gobernance that applies to all
* Database configuration
    - There is no database to [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete), so, essentially verify our [Trello board](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/auvisual/addon/trello/trello-board)
* How to run tests
    - There is no need to test anything here
* Deployment instructions
    - No updates planned
