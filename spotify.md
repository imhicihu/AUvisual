## Procedures ##
* [Log in](https://accounts.spotify.com/login?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasters.spotify.com%2Fgateway) to Spotify for Podcasters with your Spotify account, or choose `Sign Up` to create one.
* Click `Get started`.
* Paste in the link to your podcast's `RSS` feed.
* We’ll now send a verification email to the address in your RSS feed. Copy the 8-digit code from that email and paste in the submit form.
